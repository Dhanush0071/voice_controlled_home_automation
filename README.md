#AIM OF THE PROJECT
Our project “A VOICE CONTROLLED HOME AUTOMATION USNG ESP8266 WITH MQTT PROTOCOL” aims about connecting basic non internet devices like lights and fans to internet through a ESP8266 12-e microcontroller and developing a web-interface in ADAFRUIT.IO platform and for voice control we have used the IFTTT platform which provides us with applets to make our task easier
